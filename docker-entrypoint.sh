## In the Dockerfile the CMD section is as follows:

##                "cassandra",
##                "-f"
##            ],
##
## So this script will be called as ./docker-entrypoint.sh cassandra -f

# first arg is `-f` or `--some-option`
# Basically the first argument needs to be the executable that we will eventually execute way at the
# end of the script. This section allows you to call the script and not specify cassandra as the 
# executable and it will go ahead and insert it. This isn't necessary in the specific case of this dockerfile
# because CMD is set up to always pass 'cassandra' as the first argument.
#
# In terms of syntax:
# ${1:0:1} the first 1 is the variable, the :0:1 takes the first character of the varible
if [ "${1:0:1}" = '-' ]; then
    ## see https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/308260/what-does-set-do-in-this-dockerfile-entrypoint
